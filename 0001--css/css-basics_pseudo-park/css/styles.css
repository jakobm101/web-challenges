  The giraffe is afraid of the crocodile and the dino.
   - Center the giraffe in the park.
   - Align the dino to the right.

  ðŸ’¡ Select the animals by their class names and use the text-align property.

/* 
  The animals want some color! ðŸŽ¨
  When the mouse hovers over an animal, change the background color.
   - The crocodile wants to be lightblue.
   - The giraffe likes lightgreen.
   - The dino is a huge fan of lightsalmon.

  ðŸ’¡ You'll need to use a pseudo-class selector for each animal.
